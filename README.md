# DIGIT_CLASSIFICATION_USING_CNN
Hear we are Classifying the Images (as which number is it? )in the DATASET of MNIST using  Convolutional Neural Network ( ConvNet /CNN) 
# Requirements
* PYTHON 
* TENSORFLOW
* NUMPY
# DATASETS
* WE HAVE TAKEN THE "MNIST" DATASET WHICH WE CAN FIND IN TENSORFLOW(INBUILD DATASET)
*    ============>>>>>   mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist  <<<<<==============

# DATA PREPARATION
* FIRST WE SPLIT THE DATASET INTO TRAIN AND TEST DATASET
* USING MATPLOTLIB CHECKING THE TRAIN DATA (X_train) AND COMPARING IT'S CORRESPONDING OUTPUT (Y_train) 

## NORMALIZATION OF DATASET
* NORMALIZING THE TRAIN AND TEST DATA i.e. (X_train) AND (X_test)
* CHECKING THE IMAGE AFTER NORMILAZATION USING MATPLOTLIB

# MAKING READY TO TRAINING THE CNN MODEL
*IMPORTANT STEP'S TO DO:-
  1. RESHAPING THE X_train TO MAKE IT USEFULL TO CNN
  2. AFTER TAKING A PARTICULAR IMAGE APPLING THE FILTER ON CONVOLUTION LAYER
  3. THEN APPLY ACTIVATION FUNCTION WHICH IS "RELU" FUNCTION
  4. THEN APPLYING MAXPOOLING TO REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF DATA
  NOW REPEAT AGAIN ALL THE STEPS FROM 2 TO 4
  
* AFTER REPEATINE THE ABOVE PROCESS FOR 3 CONVOLUTION LAYERS
1. THEN FLATTEN THE DATA
2. MAKE DENSE LAYER AFTER THAT APPLY ACTIVATION FUNCTION
3. REPEAT THE PROCESS ONE MORE TIME
4. NOW FOR FINAL LAYER
   * MAKE DENSE LAYER AND THEN APPLY ACTIVATION FUNCTION == "SOFTMAX"
   * SOFTMAX FUNCTION ==> IT HELP US TO PREDICT THE OUTPUT USING "PROBABILITY" 

# APPLYING OPTIMIZER , LOSS FUNCTION AND ACCURACY
#NOW FITTNG THE MODEL WITH (X_train AND Y_train)
# PREDICTING THE MODEL
