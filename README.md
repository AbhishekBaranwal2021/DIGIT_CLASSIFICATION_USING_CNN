# DIGIT_CLASSIFICATION_USING_CNN
Hear we are Classifying the Images (as which number is it? )in the DATASET of MNIST using  Convolutional Neural Network ( ConvNet /CNN) 
# Requirements
* PYTHON 
* TENSORFLOW
* NUMPY
# DATASETS
* WE HAVE TAKEN THE "MNIST" DATASET WHICH WE CAN FIND IN TENSORFLOW(INBUILD DATASET)
*    ============>>>>>   mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist  <<<<<==============

# DATA PREPARATION
* FIRST WE ARE SPLIT THE DATASET INTO TRAIN AND TEST DATASET
* USING MATPLOTLIB CHECKING THE TRAIN DATA (X_train) AND COMPARING IT'S CORRESPONDING OUTPUT (Y_train) 

## NORMALIZATION OF DATASET
* NORMALIZING THE TRAIN AND TEST DATA i.e. (X_train) AND (X_test)
* CHECKING THE IMAGE AFTER NORMILAZATION USING MATPLOTLIB
